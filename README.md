## Usage

### Store

The store performs all communication with the API service and maintains a single copy of all the resources that come back from it.  This ensures that changes to a resource in one place propagate propertly to other parts of your application that use the same resource.

A property named `store` is automatically injected into all routes, controllers, and models on initialization.

Methods:
* `find(type [,id] [,options])`: Query API for records of `type`, optionally with `id` and other `options` like `filter`.  Returns a promise.
* `getById(type, id)`: Get a record from the local cache by `type` and `id`.  Returns a resource or undefined synchronously.
* `hasRecordFor(type, id)`: Returns true if a record for `type` and `id` exists in cache synchronously.
* `all(type)`: Returns a "live" array of all the records for [type] in the store.  The array will be updated as records are added and removed from the store.
* `findAll(type)`: Calls `find(type)` if it hasn't been called before, then returns `all(type)` to give you back a live list of all the records in one call.  Convenient for a model hook.
* `createRecord(data)`: Create a record given fields `data`.  Returns a `Resource`.  Does **not** add the record to the store, call `resource.save()` on the response or `\_add()` on the store.

More methods, that you shouldn't need often:
* `_add(type, obj)`: Add a record to the store.  This is normally done automatically when reading objects, but you might have created one with `createRecord` manually want it added without `resource.save()`.
* `_remove(type, obj)`: Remove a record from the store.  This doesn't tell the server about it, so you probably want `resource.delete()`.

Properties:
* `removeAfterDelete: true`: Set to false to disable automatically removing from the store after `record.delete()`.  You might want this if your API has a 2 or more step deleting vs removed vs purged state.

### Resource
A resource is a model object representing a single resource in the API.

Methods:
* `.merge(data)`: Take the values in `data` and replace the corresponding values in this resource with them.  Returns the resource so you can chain calls.
* `.replaceWith(data)`: Replace all the values in this resource with the ones in `newData`.  Returns the resource so you can chain calls.
* `.clone()`: Returns a duplicate of this resource.  Changes to the clone will not initially affect the original.  If `.save()` is called on the clone, the response data will be merged into both the clone and original.
* `.hasLink(name)`: Returns a boolean for whether this resource has a link with the given `name` or not.
* `.followLink(name [,options])`: Retrieves the link with the given `name` and returns a promise that resolves with the response data.
* `.importLink(name [,options])`: Retrieves the link with the given `name` and assigns the response data as a property with the same `name` on the resource.  Returns a promise that resolves with the resource.
* `.hasAction(name)`: Returns a boolean for whether this resource has an action with the given `name` or not.
* `.doAction(name [,data])`: Performs the action given by `name`, optionally sending `data` and returns a promise that resolves with the response data.
* `.save()`: Sends the resource to the API to persist it.  On success, adds the resource to the store if it wasn't already in there.  Returns a promise that resolves to the resource, and also updates the store record with the response data if it is provided.
* `.delete()`: Sends a delete request to the API to remove a resource.  On success, the resource is removed from the store if it was in it (unless `store.removeAfterDelete`` is false)
* `.serialize()`: Returns a plain JavaScript object representation of the resource.

Static Properties:
* `defaultSortBy: ''`: Default field to sort by when none was specified
* `mangleIn(data): A function to edit the data for a resource before it is turned into a model object for purposes of evil
* `mangleOut(data): A function to edit the data for a resource after it is serialized into a plain object for even more evil.

### Collection
A collection is a model object representing an array of resources in the API.  It is an ArrayProxy that proxies array requests to the `data` elements of the collection, but collections are themselves resources that may have links and actions themselves that you can use (as a resource, above).

* `.serialize()`: Returns a plain JavaScript array representation of the collection.
